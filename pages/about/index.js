  aboutThisWebsite: "This current website was built with Next.js using React and Material UI.\n " +
  "The design concept was minimalism-focused like most of my projects, but was centered around this one animation I had in mind before fallng asleep one time.\n" +
  "I'm not a beginner in React animations, but most of my projects included linear, or predictical movements of elements in two degrees of freedom.\n" + 
  "My basic idea was that I was going to have some text that explodes in different directions on hover/press. \n" + 
  "As terrible and traumatizing as it was, the first thing I thought of to achieve this design was linear algebra. \n" + 
  "As for the effect of exploding letters, at the time I didn't expect to be writing a log-log function to model the behaviour I wanted. \n" +
  "Nevertheless, my effort in building a pure React animation hopefully paid off. Some extra things I didn't write about: (pseudo-random position generation & animation timing)\n",
  aboutMe: "I'm a fullstack developer with experience developing with Javascript, Python, React, and Node." +
  "I enjoy spending time learning how to use new technology (this website was create with Next.js!) and playing music in my spare time!"
