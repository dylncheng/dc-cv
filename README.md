## Personal Portfolio Website

### Why?
For some reason, I thought of my name exploding into distict letters while I was in the shower. I already had a portfolio website, but
I wanted to implement this idea enough to create a new one.

### With What?
1. React
2. Next.js (A bit overkill, I know)
3. Material UI
4. Deployed on Vercel

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
